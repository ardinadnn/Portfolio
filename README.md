<div style="text-align: justify">
This is my project during internship at PT Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel), January 2022-March 2022. After cleaning the dummy dataset using Python and Microsoft Excel, my team and I constructed a comprehensive Region Dashboard which consisted of Region Dashboard, Branch/City Dashboard, Revenue Driver Matrix, and Revenue Driver Bar Chart. The entirety of this dashboard suite was constructed utilizing Microsoft Power BI. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project combined various hyperparameters: epoch, batch size, learning rate, dropout rate. The scanned dataset consisted of normal, scuffed, dirty, torn, and blurred 2016 and 2022 emision years banknotes. This study showed that VGG-16 with image processing gave the best results with the highest accuracy of 91.43%. VGG-16 with image processing gives the best average accuracy of 57.28%. VGG-19 with image processing followed with an average accuracy of 55.55%, followed by VGG-16 without image processing at 53.90%, and VGG-19 without image processing at 45.23%.</div>

- **Image processing**:
    - Image Enhancement: Histogram Equalization 
    - Image segmentation: Otsu Method
- **Classification**: VGG-16 and VGG-19 model

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project used text dataset comprising records of patient consultations with their doctor. Sastrawi Stemmer were applied due to the dataset being in Bahasa Indonesia. Elbow method showed that the optimal k = 5. Consequently, the dataset was partitioned into 25 clusters based on the optimal k-value.</div>
